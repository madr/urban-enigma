Workout companion PWA, offline first: all data is stored on the
device.

The app interface language is swedish. All weights are presented in
the metric system: kilograms (kg) and tons (1000 kg).

## Goals

Written with the following personal goals and challenges of technical
nature in mind:

- Building something [offline-first][1].
- Get to know the [Parcel bundler][2].
- Get in line according to [Prettier formatter][3].
- Continous progression in the [7-1 Sass guidelines][4].
- Keep discovering [React together with Redux][5].
- Make [LocalStorage][6] and [Redux-sagas][7] work together for
  offline-first with server sync.
- Evaluate testing React-stacked PWAs using [Jest][8] (with snapshots)
  and [Enzyme][9].

## Roadmap
