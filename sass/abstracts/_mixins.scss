// The @extend directive is a powerful feature that is frequently misunderstood.
// In general, it makes it possible to tell Sass to style a selector A as though
// it also matched selector B. Needless to say, this can be a valuable ally when
// writing modular CSS.

// Always try to define relationships via selector placeholders, not actual
// selectors. This will give you the freedom to use (and change) any naming
// convention you have for your selectors, and since relationships are only
// defined once inside the placeholders, you are far less likely to produce
// unintended selectors.
// %button {
//  display: inline-block;
//   â€¦ button styles

//   Relationship: a %button that is a child of a %modal
//   %modal > & {
//     display: block;
//   }
// }

// .button {
//    @extend %button;
// }
